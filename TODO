## Things to cover

- section about arithmetic circuits, connections, and translations between
  formalisms
- section about semiring circuits as a unifying formalism
- connections to communication complexity
- circ2diag.tex: efficiently converting circuits (in the case of linear vtrees) to diagrams
- knowlege compilers and how they work in practice

## Things to understand

- Is there a lower bound about the conversion from circuits to *non-free* BDDs?
